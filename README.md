I'm following a free online bootcamp which was streamed live on Twitch starting in January 2022 and had classes twice a week for 3 hours each (https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon).
<br>
It goes by the name of 100Devs, and was created by an in person bootcamp instructor named Leon Noel, https://twitter.com/leonnoel?lang=en , who wanted to reach people who lost their jobs due to covid and provide them an education to get a employement as a full stack engineer.
<br>
A little bit more about Leon and his ideas before he started the first cohort which was in 2021 https://leonnoel.com/100devs/
<br>
The future site of the bootcamp turned also agency: https://100devs.org/
<br>
Their LinkedIn page: https://www.linkedin.com/company/100devs/mycompany/
<br>
Their Youtube channel where you can find the recordings of those streams: https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/100devs
<br>
A community syllabus like site that you follow for each class and includes links to resources of homework, links to submit homeword, faqs, iframes of vods of the live streams, and more: https://communitytaught.org/
