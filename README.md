I'm following a free online bootcamp which was streamed live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon">"Twitch</a> starting in January 2022 and had classes twice a week for 3 hours each.
<br>
It goes by the name of 100Devs, and was created by an in person bootcamp instructor named <a href="https://twitter.com/leonnoel?lang=en">Leon Noel</a>, who wanted to reach people who lost their jobs due to covid and provide them an education to get a employement as a full stack engineer.
<br>
A <a href="https://leonnoel.com/100devs/">little bit more</a> about Leon and his ideas before he started the first cohort which was in 2021 
<br>
The <a href="https://100devs.org/">future site</a> of the bootcamp turned also agency
<br>
Their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/100devs/mycompany/">LinkedIn</a> page
<br>
Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/100devs">Youtube channel</a> where you can find the recordings of those streams
<br>
A <a href="https://communitytaught.org/
